    MOD:     Creation of file and base functionality
    AUTHOR:  Ian Chavez
    COMMENT:
        - Pull ChemSpider links from Google sheets instead of txt file
        - Creates 2 txt files: 
            - working_links.txt = SMILE strings of working compounds
            - notworking_links.txt = SMILE strings of non-working compounds
11/14/23:
    MOD:     Edit main function
    AUTHOR:  Ian Chavez
    COMMENT:
        - Added creating/clearing of working_links.txt and notworking_links.txt
